![The concept of the FAIR DO Designer](./index-img/concept.drawio.svg)

The FAIR DO Designer helps you to create Designs for properly typed PID records.
Designs make FAIR DO creation repeatable, consistent, and automatable.
Given representative metadata (in any JSON format), you can create Designs “by example”.

Designs define which information to extract and how to assemble the records.
A design can be exported as code, which can be applied repeatedly to given metadata.
You can execute the code from the command line or modify and integrate it into your application.
