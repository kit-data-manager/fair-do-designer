# Standard Blocks

The FAIR-DO Designer is equipped with a range of standard blocks inherited from the Blockly Framework. Most of these blocks are straightforward in use
and will not be described in this documentation, as most programmers will be highly familiar with the concepts.

The following categories (mostly) contain standard blocks:

 - Logic
 - Loops
 - Math
 - Text
 - Lists
 - Variables
 - Functions

All of these blocks can be used to build your design. Check the generated code of your design to see how these blocks are implemented.
