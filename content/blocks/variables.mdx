# Variables

Variable blocks allow storing arbitrary information and retrieving it at a later point in time. They work just as they do in common programming languages.

The **Variables** category on the left allows creating variables using the **Create variable...** button. Existing variables can be dragged into the workspace. There are blocks for setting and getting variables.

## Deleting variables

Any variable that is not a function parameter can be deleted by right-clicking on a variable block and selecting **Delete**. This is not available on setter-blocks.
