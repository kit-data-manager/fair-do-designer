## Inverse reference to attribute

<DemoWorkspace className="h-12" blocks={[{"type":"backlink_declaration","id":"V]S|q{b-W+MBylN]JWW4","x":10,"y":10}]} />

This block is used to automatically create backlinks to another FAIR-DO Record that has linked to this record. This block expects the PID of the attribute to be linked to as input.

The attribute PID can be provided as text, but should be provided using the [Attribute PID](#attribute-pid) block.

### Example

<DemoWorkspace className="h-12" blocks={[{"type":"backlink_declaration","id":"V]S|q{b-W+MBylN]JWW4","x":10,"y":10, inputs: { ATTRIBUTE_KEY: { block: {"type":"profile_hmc_reference_block","id":"V]S|q{b-W+MBylN]JWW4","fields":{"ATTRIBUTE":"21.T11148/1c699a5d1b4ad3ba4956"}} } } }]} />

This example will automatically return a backlink to any record referencing the current record from the `digitalObjectType` attribute. The following output is generated:

```python
BackwardLinkFor("21.T11148/1c699a5d1b4ad3ba4956")
```

## Attribute PID

<DemoWorkspace className="h-12" blocks={[{"type":"profile_hmc_reference_block","id":"V]S|q{b-W+MBylN]JWW4","x":10,"y":10,"fields":{"ATTRIBUTE":"21.T11148/1c699a5d1b4ad3ba4956"}}]} />

This block returns the PID of the selected attribute. The block is linked to a fixed FAIR-DO Profile which is denoted by its name. The block shown above returns attribute PIDs for the HelmholtzKIP FAIR-DO Profile.
Use the dropdown menu on the block to select the attribute you want to retrieve the PID for.

The block above returns/generates the following output:

```python
"21.T11148/1c699a5d1b4ad3ba4956"
```
