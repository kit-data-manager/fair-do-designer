# Records

PID records store all information assigned
to profiles and attributes
within the FAIR DO Designer.

<DemoWorkspace className="h-[5lh]" blocks={[
    {
        type: "pidrecord",
        id: "record",
        x: 10,
        y: 10
    }
]} />

The block therefore has a slot to attach profiles,
as well as additional attributes,
to represent this visually.

Depending on the blocks attached, it may or may not be possible to stack more of them together.

## Using multiple record blocks

The purpose of record blocks is not purely visual:
It is possible to add multiple record blocks.
For example, adding three record blocks means
that processing a single JSON document
will create up to three FAIR DOs,
each with their own PID.

## The Local ID slot

If you assign a value to this slot,
you can use this value to reference it.
It will later be replaced by the created PID.

> This only works if

> It will **not** work if you wrap the value.

> `"{"type", "my_complex_value", "reference": $my_local_id}"`.

## The “Skip If” slot

There are variants of the record block which have an additional slot:

<DemoWorkspace className="h-[6lh]" blocks={[
    {
        type: "pidrecord_skipable",
        id: "record",
        x: 10,
        y: 10
    }
]} />

You can attach a boolean block to this slot if you want to skip a record.
If the boolean is `false`, the record will be ignored.
The default is `true`.
