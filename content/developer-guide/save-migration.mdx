# Save Migration

Whenever breaking changes are made to the blocks included with the app, old saves may have to be migrated. The following changes are considered breaking for the save file:

 - Block type changes (renaming or removing)
 - Block input changes (renaming or removing)
 - Adding required fields to blocks

Whenever these changes are necessary, the type of the block should be changed.

```
some-block -> some-block-1
some-block-6 -> some-block-7
```

Then a save file migration must be added for the old name of the block. This allows easily tracking necessary migrations across multiple versions of the app.

## Migration Methods

There are two methods available for migrating save files:

 - **JSON-based**: Simple text-replace migrations can be applied before the save file is loaded into Blockly
 - **Blockly-based**: Blockly-based migrations can be applied (using a migration workspace) to the save file after it is loaded into Blockly

JSON-based migrations are preferred for simple migrations. Blockly-based migrations are preferred for more complex migrations. JSON-based migrations are always run first, the Blockly-based migrations are run after.

### JSON-based Migrations

To add a migration using the JSON mechanism you must add a Migration function to the `lib/migrate/json_migrate.ts` file. A Migration function has the following signature:

```ts
type Migration = (data: WorkspaceData) => WorkspaceData
```

To make migrations easier, a MigrationHelper class is provided. This class can be used to search for blocks of a specific type and call a handler for each one. An example migration might look like this:

```ts
const exampleMigration: Migration = (data) => {
    const helper = new MigrationHelper(data)

    helper.handleBlockType("example_block_0", (block) => {
        if (block.fields?.example_field === "old_value") {
            block.fields.example_field = "new_value"
        }

        block.type = "example_block_1"

        return block
    })

    return data
}
```

This migration will find all blocks of type `example_block_0` and change the value of the `example_field` field to `new_value`. It will also change the type of the block to `example_block_1`. Migrations are run in the order they are added to the `migrations` array in `lib/migrate/json_migrate.ts`.
