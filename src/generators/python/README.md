## Development

You do not need to build the code. The npm build process will import parts of the code as text. But for development, you should create the virtual environment. Recommended:

- [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- run `uv sync`
- VScode and other IDEs should now detect the available dev dependencies.
