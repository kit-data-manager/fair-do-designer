This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Development

One way is to use the compose file to run a development container:

```bash
podman compose up -d
# if you use docker:
# docker compose up -d
```

You can then use vscode to attach to the container.
The dev server is available at http://localhost:8080/fair-do-designer.
The container comes pre-installed with required tooling like node/npm and uv.

Otherwise, use these manual steps (install required tooling manually in beforehand):

- `pipx run pre-commit install` to enable all pre-commit hooks.
- `npm ci && npm run build && npm run dev` to install dependencies for npm and run the service.

### Python setup

We use `uv`, which handles the setup properly if you execute a command.
For the commands, refer to `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
It includes a sync step which can normally be skipped, as it should be executed implicitly.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
